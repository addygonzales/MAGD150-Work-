## Welcome to my Github!

I am senior at UW-Whitewater enrolled in a Media Arts and Game Development in my last semster of college.  

I have uploaded some assingments from the semester while working with processing.  

For lab 1 I built what was suppose to look like a small city sky line using rectangles and an ellipse being the moon.  I used a gray scale for the colors and backgrounds.

For lab 2 I built something that was supose to look like it was from outerspace.  Using arcs, a quad, trianlge, and different color modes to try and create something that looked like a spaceship on a planet.

Lab 3 was using Math with mouse X and mouse Y and one ellipse in the top left corner with another ellipse coming out of the top left corner ellipse.  [Click here for lab 3] https://github.com/addygonzales/MAGD150-Work-/blob/gh-pages/s19magd150lab3_Gonzales/s19magd150lab3_Gonzales.pde

Lab 4 was pizza themed! Creating ellipses within one another to create the pizza and the crust.  Using 'if else' statements clicking numbers 1, 2, & 3 will change the color of the pizza from red, green, and white.  Using toggles will make statements true and false.

Lab 9 is image, sound, and video.  My image was a cupcake, bang was the sound, and the video was tinting the image.

Processing was brand new to me and these are basic images but overall enjoyed learning something new.
